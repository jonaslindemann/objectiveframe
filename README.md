# ObjectiveFrame - README

ObjectiveFrame is a finite element beam analysis application developed at Structural Mechanics at Lund university by Jonas Lindemann in his PhD work. The application focused on how to make finite element analysis real-time explorable with direct feedback methods.

ObjectiveFrame has also been used to develop distributed techniques for finite element applications using the CORBA framework.

The application has also been used as an experimental application for user interface techniques within the field of finite element analysis. Daniel Ã…kesson implemented 3d gesture controls using a leap-controller for interacting with finite element models.

Pierre Olsson developed routines and user interfaces for computing section properties.

## Implementation details.

The application is implemented as a C++ application using OpenGL for hardware accelerated rendering. ObjectiveFrame uses a scene graph model implemented using the C++ library Interactive Visualisation Framework - Ivf++ (https://github.com/jonaslindemann/ivfplusplus). The solver is implemented using the matrix-library Newmat11. 

This version of the application has been given a large overhaul both with regards to C++ and the user interface. To increase the interactive aspect of the application the user interface has been reimplemented using the ImGui - library (https://github.com/ocornut/imgui). This is an immediate mode user interface library that provides a state-less user interface rendered directly in the OpenGL window. 

## Future development

 * The ImGui implementation still builds on the FLTK library as it has been a large effort to unbind the close ties to this library. The next iterations will base the implementation directly on the GLFW library. (COMPLETED)
 * User interface improvements. There is a still a lot of non-standard ways of interacting with the application, but these are also some things that will be worked out in upcoming versions. (ONGOING)
 * Interactions with the CALFEM for Python library. I would like to see the application as a pre-processor for generating CALFEM code that can be used by students in Structural Mechanics. (ONGOING)
 * An improved solver - Currently the newmat-based solver works OK, but lacks scalability as it is not very actively maintained. The eigen-library would be a candidate to replace newmat. (COMPLETED)
 * More ways of extending the application with additional solvers, geometry generation and more. 
 * A richer scripting API.
