# Develop and extend ObjectiveFrame

ObjectiveFrame is a C++ application built upon several libraries. To build the application required libraries have to be built. The main library used is Ivf++. This is an object-oriented 3D scene graph library encapsulating the OpenGL library. The second library is GLFW for creating OpenGL windows and providing a source of window events.
