# Develop and extend ObjectiveFrame

ObjectiveFrame is a C++ application built upon several libraries. To build the application required libraries have to be built. The main library used is Ivf++. This is a object oriented 3D scene graph libary encapsulating the OpenGL library. The second library required is FLTK, which is a multiplatform user interface library available for Windows, Linux and macOS. Future versions of ObjectiveFrame will use ImGui on top of GLFW instead. The following sections describe how to build the libraries and the application on Windows. Linux and macOS will come later.
