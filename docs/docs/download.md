## Known compatibility issues

* ObjectiveFrame works best with a modern NVIDIA based graphics card (GTX 10xx, 20xx, 30xx). 
* Offscreen rendering for antialiasing doesn't work correctly under Intel-based graphics cards.
* ObjectiveFrame requires a graphics driver with an available compatibility profile available as the code uses the fixed function pipeline in OpenGL.
* As ObjectiveFrame uses a immediate mode user interface toolkit the Window will be redrawn continously, leading to a more responsive application, but also uses more resources.
